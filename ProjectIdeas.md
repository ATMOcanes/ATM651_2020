# Some Project Ideas 

About 12 hours of work directed at a topic or tool of your choice: learning, presenting to class, and capturing the learning for yourself for later in a few pages of complete sentences and references or links. . 

* Read about some topic: I can help you craft search terms and find top papers. Read at least 3 papers, with distinct or contrasting takes (or a Review and two research studies). Annotate in hypothes.is for conversation with me, write a few-page coherent document, and make a presentation to class. 
  * Climate issue: migrating latitudes of tropics/subtropics, warming poles and meandering jet, ENSO effects, something with a dynamical issue in it. 
  * Weather phenomenon with a dynamical aspect 
  * Advanced dynamical issue (quasi-geostrophic theory, etc.) 

* [COMEt/MetEd](https://www.meted.ucar.edu/index.php) modules of level 2 or higher totaling enough hours: quizzes sent to me (they are not easy!), and report to class on new things you learned.

* [Display and discuss MERRA2 Budgets (Appendix)](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/pubs/docs/Bosilovich785.pdf) of the equations underpinning some atmospheric event: hourly for a weather event, monthly for climate. Vertical integrals, 3D terms. We will do a Lab on this for the heat budget soon, learning about all the kinds of atmospheric heating processes. 

* Tools-oriented study, like ML/AI presentations [here](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/star/meeting_2020AIWorkshop.php) for example.
