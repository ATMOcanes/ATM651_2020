24-26	|Reiterate assignment to read W&H Chapter 1 and ponder all its end-of-chapter questions: we will go over all those questions verbally soon. Discuss kinematic "ingredients" of flow fields and assign [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uY31iYu5dZ5E9F-UoYrpWQf4UnJLvoKG?usp=sharing#scrollTo=IWjRtVAGK6Fk).| Words about probability (ensembles = frequentism, as one facet of human judgement = Bayesian). A vectors have direction+magnitude but is moved as a trick for adding; vector *fields* have vectors *at every location*. Practiced vector field addition and went over student Colab notebook results.
