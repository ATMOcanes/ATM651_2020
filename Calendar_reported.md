Aug 17-19 |Welcome, introductions, syllabus. Software. MKS units. Assign to read W&H Chapter 1 [Records](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/tree/master/Class_sessions/2020-08-17) | TC check-in. Whiteboard: MKS units, coordinates, functions, derivatives.  [Records](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/tree/master/Class_sessions/2020-08-19) 
24-26	|Reiterate assignment to read W&H Chapter 1 and ponder all its end-of-chapter questions: we will go over all those questions verbally soon. Discuss kinematic "ingredients" of flow fields and assign [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uY31iYu5dZ5E9F-UoYrpWQf4UnJLvoKG?usp=sharing#scrollTo=IWjRtVAGK6Fk).| Words about probability (ensembles = *frequentist*, as one facet of human judgement = *Bayesian*). Then: a vector has direction+magnitude, but can be moved as a trick for adding; vector *fields* have vectors *at every location*. Practiced vector field addition and went over student Colab notebook results. [Records.](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/tree/master/Class_sessions/2020-08-26%20kinematics%2C%20vector%20field%20decomposition). Assignment: read WH ch1 for Monday. 
31-2 Sep|WH ch1 questions, as advertized. Mass flux as jumping-off point to flux in general (e.g. pressure is a *momentum flux* with units of momentum per unit area per second. Also speak of *Eulerian vs. Lagrangian* time derivatives, whose difference (we shall see) is *advection*. [Records](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/tree/master/Class_sessions/2020-08-30%20flux%2C%20stationary%20patterns) | "Transport": Flux, its convergence, advection, and diffusion.
