-------|------------- | ------------- 
Aug 17-19 |Welcome, introductions, syllabus. Software. MKS units. Assign to read W&H Chapter 1 [Records](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/tree/master/Class_sessions/2020-08-17) | TC check-in. Whiteboard: MKS units, coordinates, functions, derivatives.  [Records](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/tree/master/Class_sessions/2020-08-19) 
24-26	|Reiterate assignment to read W&H Chapter 1 and ponder all its end-of-chapter questions: we will go over all those questions verbally soon. Discuss kinematic "ingredients" of flow fields and assign [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uY31iYu5dZ5E9F-UoYrpWQf4UnJLvoKG?usp=sharing#scrollTo=IWjRtVAGK6Fk).| Words about probability (ensembles = *frequentist*, as one facet of human judgement = *Bayesian*). Then: a vector has direction+magnitude, but can be moved as a trick for adding; vector *fields* have vectors *at every location*. Practiced vector field addition and went over student Colab notebook results. [Records.](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/tree/master/Class_sessions/2020-08-26%20kinematics%2C%20vector%20field%20decomposition). Assignment: read WH ch1 for Monday. 
31-2 Sep|WH ch1 questions, as advertized. Mass flux as jumping-off point to flux in general (e.g. pressure is a *momentum flux* with units of momentum per unit area per second. Also speak of *Eulerian vs. Lagrangian* time derivatives, whose difference (we shall see) is *advection*. [Records](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/tree/master/Class_sessions/2020-08-31%20flux%2C%20stationary%20patterns) | "Transport": Lagrangian view (*material* derivative d/dt and trajectories). Eulerian view (*partial* time derivative and *local* tendencies) - advection form, flux convergence form. Advection and diffusion. [Records](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/tree/master/Class_sessions/2020-09-02%20transport%2C%20flux%20vs.%20advection%20).
7-9	|LABOR DAY | Vorticity conservation and transport; notice downstream development aspect of current western US extremes. Discuss WH ch7 reading through 7.2.6, students answers to 7.5 a-k, collect HW problems 7.6-7.10. Breakout group IDV exercise on how *trajectores* computed from V(t) data relate to *transport* of *tracer* zeta (vorticity). [Records](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/tree/master/Class_sessions/2020-09-09%20IDV%20trajectories%20and%20vorticity%20as%20tracer).
|14-16	|Vortex interactions: a game of pinball among Rankine vortices. The pieces of how it relates to HW problems 7.6 and 7.9, and d/dt(conserved)=0, and the Laplacian (*divergence of gradient*, a measure of *curvature*) and its inverse, and current weather [Records](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/tree/master/Class_sessions/2020-09-14%20vortex%20interactions%2C%20HW1), recording link emailed | Vorticity film discussion. Conservation of abs vorticity --> *Rossby waves* with westward phase speed but eastward group (energy) speed *proportional to wavelength squared*. [Records](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/tree/master/Class_sessions/2020-09-16%20vorticity%20films%2C%20absvor-Rossbywaves)  
21-23	|Two ways to tackle d/dt(blah) = blah1 + blah2: 1. attack or ignore RHS [("conservation")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeNSMJtKGc0); 2. Ignore LHS ("balance", hydrostatic or geostrophic)|
